TESTING TOOLS TO USE!!!

	- test runner - Jest
	- testing utilities - ("simulate" the React App (mounts components, allows us to dig into the DOM)) - Enzyme
	
What should we test?

	- isolated units - test your reducer functions, etc
	- conditional output - if something renders when a certain condition is met, test that!
	
What shouldnt we test?

	- dont test the libraries themselves (dont test react, etc)
	- dont test complex connections!!!
	
ENZYME "SHALLOW" METHOD:

	- DOES A SHALLOW COPY OF A REACT COMPONENT
	
		- YOU CAN PASS PROPERTIES TO THE SHALLOWLY RENDERED COMPONENT AND, BASED ON THOSE, CAN "EXPECT" CERTAIN OUTPUT BASED ON WHAT IS PASSED IN
		
Setting up properties, components, etc. before a test:

	- built in beforeEach function. runs before each test and can set up whatever needs to be set up to prevent code becoming redundant
	- "after" also exists if you need to tear anything down when a test has completed
	
- lots of good docs online for JEST and ENZYME
